# 🛒 E-Commerce Management System with PostgreSQL (Java)

## 📖 Description
This project is a **Java-based E-Commerce Management System** that demonstrates interaction between a Java application and a **PostgreSQL database**.  
It allows clients and sellers to manage products, shopping carts, and purchase histories directly from the console interface.

The main goal of this project is to practice database connectivity, SQL queries, and backend logic using **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**.  
All user actions (like adding products, viewing carts, or making purchases) are handled via console input and reflected in the database.

## 💡 Motivation
The project was developed as part of a programming and database integration exercise.  
It focuses on understanding how **Java interacts with relational databases**, using **PostgreSQL** for persistent data management — including inserts, updates, queries, and table relations.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools
- **Language:** Java  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Connection Library:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)  
- **Environment:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  
- **Data Entities:** Clients, Sellers, Products, Carts, History  

---

## 🏗️ Database Structure
The PostgreSQL database includes several key tables:
- **Clients:** stores user information  
- **Sellers:** manages seller details  
- **Products:** contains product information  
- **Cart:** current shopping cart of each client  
- **History:** stores previously purchased items  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 👤 Manage client and seller records  
- 🛍️ Add, update, and delete products  
- 🧺 Manage client shopping carts  
- 💳 Purchase items and save them to the history table  
- 🔄 Retrieve and display data from PostgreSQL  
- 🧱 Demonstrates full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program connects to a PostgreSQL database using **JDBC**.  
2. Data such as products, clients, and orders are retrieved and displayed via the console.  
3. When a user performs an action (e.g., adding to cart), the corresponding SQL operation runs and updates the database.  
4. Results are printed directly to the console.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Database design and SQL query writing  
- Java-to-database connection using JDBC  
- Object-oriented design combined with database logic  
- CRUD operations with data persistence  
- Console-based user interaction  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add a GUI or web-based frontend  
- Implement login and role-based access control  
- Add input validation and exception handling  
- Integrate payment simulation or order tracking  
- Use ORM frameworks like Hibernate for advanced DB handling
